##Chapter 3: GVA in individual DCMS Sectors – Current Prices
***

&nbsp;

This chapter builds on the analysis in chapter 2, providing more context and looking at the estimates for each individual sector. There is significant overlap between DCMS Sectors so users should be aware that the estimate for “DCMS Sectors Total” is lower than the sum of the individual sectors. It is also worth noting that those larger sub-sectors, which are found within multiple sectors, for example in Creative Industries and Cultural Sector, are likely to drive the trends in the same way for both sectors. **Estimates for the Tourism Sector have been included, taking into account the methodological changes mentioned in Chapter 2**.

&nbsp;

Data tables accompanying this chapter (for sector and sub-sector) are available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-2017-gva).

<h3>How is Civil Society defined?</h3>
For GVA expressed in current prices, the estimate for the Civil Society covers non-market charities sitting in the NPISH (non-profit institutions serving households) sector. 
It does not include market provider charities who have passed the
market test and therefore sit in the corporate sector (these data are not currently measured
by ONS on a National Accounts basis), mutuals, social enterprises or community interest
companies.

More information on the Civil Society definition can be found in Annex A.

<p class="ig-title">3.7% decrease<br>since 2016</p>
</div>



**Key Findings** 
&nbsp;

Civil Society **contributed £23.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **1.3% of UK GVA**. This sector saw an increase of 24.1% since 2010 (at £19.0bn) although declined by 3.7% since 2016 (£24.4bn in 2016).

    <div id="figure_3_1"></div>
</div>


**Volunteering** is a key element of the Civil Society sector. However it has not been included in the above figures due to volunteering being part of the informal economy, and therefore not captured in the ONS's methodology for calculating GVA, as is the case also with other unpaid home production such as child and adult care. Any overlaps between other DCMS Sectors and volunteering cannot be calculated. As estimated in the ONS published [Household Satellite Account](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/theuktourismsatelliteaccountuktsa2016), volunteering contributed **£24bn** in 2016 (this includes only formal volunteering activities).

<h3>How are the Creative Industries defined? </h3>
The Creative Industries were defined in the Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creative-industries-mapping-documents-2001">2001 Creative Industries Mapping Document</a> as “those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property”. 
The DCMS definition is a UK definition based on international industrial codes. It includes the following sub-sectors: 
<ul>
<li>Advertising and marketing;</li>
<li>Architecture;</li>
<li>Crafts;</li>
<li>Design and designer fashion;</li>
<li>Film, TV, video, radio and photography;</li>
<li>IT, software and computer services;</li>
<li>Publishing;</li>
<li>Museums, galleries and libraries; and</li>
<li>Music, performing and visual arts.</li>

<div class="arrow-svg" id="ci-arrow"></div>
<p class="ig-title">7.1% increase<br>since 2016</p>
</div>

**Key Findings** 
&nbsp;

The Creative Industries **contributed £101.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **5.5% of GVA in the UK**.

&nbsp;

Between 2010 and 2017, the Creative Industries GVA increased by 53.1% (£66.3bn in 2010). This was the fastest growth among the DCMS sectors, and an **increase nearly twice as fast as the UK economy** (28.7% increase in the UK between 2010 and 2017). 

&nbsp;

The 'IT, software and computer services’ sub-sector is the largest Creative Industries sub-sector, accounting for £40.6bn in 2017 (40.0% of Creative Industries GVA in 2017). It is also a key driver of growth in the sector, having grown 9.1% since 2016 and 59.9% since 2010. 

&nbsp;

The ‘Film, TV, video, radio and photography’ sub-sector accounted for 16.5% of Creative Industries GVA in 2017 at £16.7bn. The ‘Advertising and marketing’ sub-sector accounted for 13.1% of Creative Industries GVA. These sub-sectors’ GVA values have increased by 8.9% and 5.8% respectively since 2016.

<ul>
<li>Arts;</li>
<li>Film, TV, and music; </li>
<li>Radio;</li>
<li>Photography; </li>
<li>Crafts; </li>

</div>

**Key Findings** 

&nbsp;

The Cultural Sector **contributed £29.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017 and accounted for **1.6% of UK GVA**. The contribution of the Cultural Sector increased by 7.2% between 2016 and 2017, and by 38.5% since 2010. 


&nbsp;

Over three fifths (60.2%) of the Cultural Sector GVA was in the ‘Film, TV and music’ sub-sector (contributing £17.8bn in 2017), where GVA increased by 9.4% between 2016 and 2017, and 39.0% since 2010.

&nbsp;

Nearly a quarter (24.8%) of Cultural Sector GVA was accounted for by the ‘Arts’ sub-sector. This sub-sector has increased by 62.6% since 2010, from £4.5bn in 2010 to £7.3bn in 2017, and increased by 6.2% since 2016 (£6.9bn in 2016).

</div>


**Key Findings** 

&nbsp;

The Digital Sector **contributed £130.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **7.1% of UK GVA**. This sector saw the greatest percentage increase of all DCMS Sectors between 2016 and 2017 (7.3%). This is faster than the GVA for the total UK economy, which increased by 4.8%. This Sector has also increased by 32.9% since 2010 (compared to 28.7% for the total UK economy).

&nbsp;

There has been a steady growth in the ‘Computer programming, consultancy and related activities’ sub-sector in 2017. This sub-sector, which contributed over a third (37.1%) of the Digital Sector GVA in 2017, saw an increase in GVA value of 9.4% since 2016, and of 44.2% since 2010.

&nbsp;

The ‘Telecoms’ sub-sector accounted for a quarter (25.0%) of Digital Sector GVA in 2017, contributing £32.6bn in 2017. This is an increase of 3.6% since 2016 and 31.6% since 2010.

**Key Findings** 

&nbsp;

The Gambling Sector **contributed £9.3bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **0.5% of UK GVA**. This is a decrease of £10.1bn since 2016. Since 2010, the Gambling Sector has increased by 10.3% (£8.4bn in 2010).

&nbsp;

The Gambling Sector is a small industry and therefore can lead to some data volatility each year due to the sample size of businesses. The decline in GVA since 2015 is partly due to the restructure of businesses in this sector.

<h3>How is Sport defined?  </h3>
For the purposes of this publication the statistical definition of sport has been used, which incorporates only those activities which are predominately sport-related. The definition encompasses (among other activities): the manufacture and retail sale of sports goods and other goods relating to physical activities; the renting and leasing of sports and recreational goods; the operation of sports and fitness facilities; and activities of sports clubs.

&nbsp;

The Sports Sector GVA has increased by 40.0% since 2010 (£7.0bn in 2010), although it is worth noting a decline in the Sports Sector in 2013 is likely to be caused by the effects of the UK hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.

**Notes**

&nbsp;

<font size="-4">
1. Estimates for Tourism are based on a different methodology to all other sectors, as they are taken from the Tourism Satellite Account. Several methodology improvements were made for the 2016 Tourism data, which resulted in the 2015 data being revised. In 2016, several improvements were made to the Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS). More information on these changes can be found in Chapter 3 of the methodology note. As a result of these changes, a 15% increase was observed in the levels of visits reported by respondents. The 2015 data have been revised in line with the increased level of reporting of day visits. This change has not yet been implemented in the data prior to 2015. ONS plan to implement these changes in 2019 and therefore, caution should be taken when comparing data from 2015 onwards with previous years.</font>
