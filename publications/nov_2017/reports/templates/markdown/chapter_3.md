##Chapter 2: GVA – current prices
***

&nbsp;

This chapter builds on the analysis in chapter 2, providing more context and looking at the estimates for each individual sector. There is significant overlap between DCMS sectors so users should be aware that the estimate for “DCMS Sectors Total” is lower than the sum of the individual sectors. It is also worth noting that those larger SIC codes, which are found within multiple sectors, for example in Creative Industries and Cultural Sector, are likely to drive the trends in the same way for both sectors. Data tables accompanying this chapter (for sector and sub-sector) are available at **xxxxx**

**Civil Society**

* Key Findings 

Civil Society **contributed {{ ci_2017 }}** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **{{1.3%}} of UK GVA**. This sector saw an increase of {{24.1%}} since 2010 (at {{£19.0bn}}) although declined by {{3.7%}} since 2016 ({{£24.4bn}} in 2016).

**Volunteering** is a key element of the Civil Society sector. However it has not been included in the above figures due to volunteering being part of the informal economy, and therefore not captured in the ONS's methodology for calculating GVA. Any overlaps between other DCMS sectors and volunteering cannot be calculated. If we were to include volunteering in the GVA figure, then you would also need to include other unpaid home production such as child and adult care in the UK GVA total. It is estimated that in 2017, volunteering contributed £31.5bn, 1.7% to the UK economy1. This includes both formal and informal volunteering activities. 

&nbsp;

&ast; To calculate the volunteering estimates - The total number of hours are taken from the Community Life Survey (2017/18) and multiplied by an appropriate wage rate from the ASHE survey to estimate output of frequent volunteering. Currently, we are unable to identify intermediate consumption of the voluntary activity, and have therefore assumed, the gross value added (GVA) is equal to output.

**Creative Industries**

* Key Findings 

The Creative Industries **contributed £101.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **5.5% of GVA in the UK**.

&nbsp;

Between 2010 and 2017, the Creative Industries GVA increased by 53.1% (£66.3bn in 2010) – **increasing nearly twice as fast as the UK economy** (28.7% increase in the UK between 2010 and 2017). 

&nbsp;

The Creative Industries had the greatest percentage increase compared to other DCMS sectors since 2010, increasing by 53.1% from £66.3bn in 2010 to £101.5bn in 2017. 

&nbsp;

The IT, software and computer services sub-sector drove this growth in the Creative Industries (accounting for £40.6bn in 2017), a 9.1% increase from 2016 and 2017, and a 59.9% increase since 2010. This sub-sector contributed over a third (40.0%) of the Creative Industries GVA in 2017. 

The Film, TV, video, radio and photography sub-sector accounted for 16.5% of Creative Industries GVA at £16.6bn and the Advertising and Marketing sub-sector accounted for 14.1% of Creative Industries GVA. Both these sub-sectors have increased from 8.9% and 5.8% respectively since 2016.

&nbsp;

**Cultural Sector**

* Key Findings

The Cultural Sector **contributed £29.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017 and accounted for **1.6% of UK GVA**. The Cultural Sector increased by 7.2% between 2016 and 2017, and by 38.5% since 2010. 


&nbsp;

Over three fifths (60.2%) of the Cultural Sector GVA was in the Film, TV and music sub-sector (contributing £17.8bn in 2017), where GVA increased by 9.4% between 2016 and 2017, and 39.0% since 2010.

Nearly a quarter (24.8%) of Cultural Sector GVA was accounted for by the Arts sub-sector. This sub-sector increased by 62.6% since 2010, from £4.5bn in 2010 to £7.3bn in 2017.

&nbsp;

**Digital Sector**

* Key Findings

The Digital Sector **contributed £130.5bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **7.1% of UK GVA**. This sector had the greatest percentage increase in the DCMS sectors between 2016 and 2017 (7.3%). This is faster than the total UK GVA, which increased by 4.8%. This Sector has also increased by 32.9% since 2010.

&nbsp;
There has been a steady growth in the Computer programming, consultancy and related activities sub-sector in 2017. This sub-sector contributed over a third (37.1%) of the Digital Sector GVA in 2017, an increase of 9.4% since 2016, and 44.2% since 2010.

The Telecommunications sub-sector accounted for a quarter (25.0%) of Digital Sector GVA in 2017, contributing £32.6bn in 2017, an increase of 3.6% since 2016 and 63.1% since 2010.

&nbsp;

**Gambling**

* Key Findings

The Gambling Sector **contributed £9.3bn** to the UK economy in 2017. This is a decrease of £10.1bn since 2016 and accounted for **0.5% of UK GVA** in 2017. Since 2010, the Gambling Sector has increased by 10.3% (£8.4bn in 2010).

&nbsp;

The Gambling Sector is a small industry and therefore can lead to some data volatility each year due to the sample size of businesses. The decline in GVA since 2015 is partly due to the restructure of businesses in this sector.

&nbsp;

**Sport**

* Key Findings

The Sports Sector **contributed £9.8bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **0.5% of UK GVA**. This is an increase of 5.3% since 2016 (£9.3bn in 2016) and a 40.0% increase since 2010 (£7.0bn in 2010)

&nbsp;

**Telecoms**

* Key Findings

The Telecoms Sector **contributed £32.6bn** to the UK economy in 2017, accounting for **1.8% of UK GVA**. This is an increase of 3.6% since 2016 (31.4bn in 2016) and a 31.6% increase since 2010 (£24.8bn in 2010).
