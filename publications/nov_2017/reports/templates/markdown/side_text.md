This release provides estimates of the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy, measured by gross value added (GVA). Other economic measures, such as employment, trade and number of businesses are available in separate publications.

The DCMS sectors cover:

1. Civil Society
1. Creative Industries
1. Cultural Sector
1. Digital Sector
1. Gambling
1. Sport
1. Telecoms
1. Tourism

&nbsp;
