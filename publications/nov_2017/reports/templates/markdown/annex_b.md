##Annex B: External Data Sources
***

&nbsp;
It is recognised that there are always different ways to define sectors, but their relevance depends on what they are needed for. Government generally favours classification systems which are 
* rigorously measured, 
* internationally comparable, 
* nationally consistent, and 
* ideally applicable to specific policy interventions. 

&nbsp;

These are the main reasons for DCMS using SIC code based definitions for its sectors. However DCMS accept that there are limitations with this approach (see Annex A), and alternative definitions can be useful where a policy-relevant grouping of businesses crosses existing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. DCMS are aware of other estimates of DCMS sectors. These estimates use varying methodologies and can be useful for serving several purposes, e.g. monitoring progress under specific policy themes such as community health or the environment, or measuring activities subsumed across a range of SICs. While potentially useful, the quality of the data depends on that of the evidence used to estimate the appropriate share of existing SICs. 

&nbsp;
The table shows different sources of analysis measuring the economic contribution of different DCMS policy areas from our Arm’s Length Bodies. It is recognised that there will be many other sources of evidence from industry bodies, for example, which have not been included in this table. This will be developed over time to capture a wider spectrum of stakeholder’s releases.

This is based on the DCMS Community Life Survey and multiplying participation by the median earnings. This is a similar methodology used by DCMS to estimate the impact of volunteering on the economy. However these figures should not be included in the GVA figure for the economy due to volunteering being part of the informal economy, and therefore not captured in the ONS's methodology for calculating GVA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

They use similar SIC codes to DCMS' Economic Estimates, but rather than using the supply and use tables and then the Annual Business Survey to inform the proportions to use, ACE use only the Annual Business Survey and therefore an approximate measure of GVA. Employment is based on Business Register and Employment Survey which is a business survey and an official statistic. However it only covers employed jobs. This is different to DCMS' approach using the Annual Population Survey where employed and self-employed jobs are included, but it is a social survey and therefore relies on the household individual defining their sector of work, which can be a limitation to this approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Creative Industries and Cultural Sector | Film, TV, video, radio and photography and IT, software and computer services | British Film Institute | Provides a value of GVA and FTE employment accountable by the Screen sector. The analysis uses a bespoke economic impact model developed for this study, reflecting current best practice in economic impact modelling, aligning the study with current government evaluation methodology (HM Treasury Green Book 2018). The estimates of FTE labour compensation and GVA generated by film and HETV production have been updated through the application of a separate ‘Job Creation Model’ commissioned by the BFI, and to be published Autumn 2018. This is a different methodology to DCMS' estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Creative Industries and Cultural Sector      | Museums, Galleries and Libraries and Museums and Galleries                    | Arts Council England   | Arts Council England have commissioned a report which looks at the economic impact of museums in England in 2013. This methodology varies greatly to DCMS Sector Economic Estimates. The definiton of museums is much wider than is used in DCMS' estimates which is based on one SIC code. ACE have identified the limitations with using SIC codes for museums, namely that to be included in the official statistical surveys, the museum needs to be registered for PAYE or VAT, which means some of the small museums would not be included in these official sources. The same applies to local authority delivered museum services which would be coded under the Public Administration SIC code. As a result ACE have used a bottom-up approach of developing a database of museums in England then using various sources to identify the economic measures for each museum. This is for England and was produced in 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Historic England use a satellite account approach to measure the heritage sector. Satellite accounts measure a sector by aggregating shares of other SICs, estimated using additional information. They can serve several purposes, eg monitoring progress under specific policy theme. While potentially useful, the quality of the data depends on that of the evidence used to estimate the appropriate share of existing SICs. These figures are useful in building the sectoral narrative, and in advocacy work (eg in speeches, alongside our sector estimates). However the scope of the industries included is much wider than for DCMS' estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The methods are different to DCMS' Economic Estimates to reflect the different data sources available to the Gambling Commission and their policy needs. The Gambling Commission derive their estimates from the operators. It is a license requirement for operators to submit returns, so essentially a census is being carried here. This has benefits over using a sample survey like DCMS use. DCMS are only using SIC 92 to define Gambling; however it is likely that there will be companies outside of SIC 92 included in the Gambling Commission statistics. For example, some working men's clubs may hold a license but would not be classified under SIC 92 by virtue of their other primary activities. Finally, Gambling Commission do not produce an estimate of GVA; instead GGY. This is because this measure is understood by the sector as a whole and is internationally comparable. This means Gambling Commission can compare historically and internationally, but it does mean it is not comparable against other sectors. |

This has not been updated since 2013 and covers England only. GVA is split by participation and consumption. The definition is wider than DCMS currently uses in its narrow definition, but is similar to the sport satellite account approach which uses the vilnius definition. This means elements such as sport broadcasting are included. While potentially useful, the quality of the data depends on that of the evidence used to estimate the appropriate share of existing SICs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Whilst this is not fully comparable with DCMS' estimates due to its much narrower scope in terms of sports, it uses a similar methodology to the DCMS Sport satellite account. Please note that this Sport satellite account is not currently part of the DCMS Sector Economic Estimates so there will be further differences in methodology and scope of industries. UK Sport use a satellite account approach for a portfolio of sports. They produce a GVA and employment estimates, using a range of sources: ABS/ASHE, 2014 Input-Output tables, Participation data and company accounts. Whilst these are not the exact same data sources as DCMS uses, or the most up to date, they do enable a comparison to DCMS statistics. They are therefore a robust estimate if the user are looking for specific Olympic and Paralympic sports. However, as with all satellite accounts, the quality of the data depends on that of the evidence used to estimate the appropriate share of existing SICs.                                                                                  |

This is based on a bespoke model, but the direct tourism industry figures have consistency with the Tourism Satellite Account methodology, which DCMS uses for its Tourism estimates in the DCMS Sector Economic Estimates. It is based on 2008 to 2011, so is more outdated than DCMS estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
