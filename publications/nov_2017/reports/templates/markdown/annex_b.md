##Annex B: External Data Sources
***

&nbsp;

It is recognised that there are always different ways to define sectors, but their relevance depends on what they are needed for. Government generally favours classification systems which are 
* rigorously measured, 
* internationally comparable, 
* nationally consistent, and 
* ideally applicable to specific policy interventions. 

&nbsp;

These are the main reasons for DCMS using SIC code based definitions for its sectors. However DCMS accept that there are limitations with this approach (see Annex A), and alternative definitions can be useful where a policy-relevant grouping of businesses crosses existing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. DCMS are aware of other estimates of DCMS sectors. These estimates use varying methodologies and can be useful for serving several purposes, e.g. monitoring progress under specific policy themes such as community health or the environment, or measuring activities subsumed across a range of SICs. While potentially useful, the quality of the data depends on that of the evidence used to estimate the appropriate share of existing SICs. 

&nbsp;
The table shows different sources of analysis measuring the economic contribution of different DCMS policy areas from our Arm’s Length Bodies. It is recognised that there will be many other sources of evidence from industry bodies, for example, which have not been included in this table. This will be developed over time to capture a wider spectrum of stakeholder’s releases.
