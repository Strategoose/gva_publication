##Chapter 5: Next Steps
***

&nbsp;

DCMS have developed a suite of economic estimates which help support policy and understand the economic impact our sectors have on the UK economy. The GVA estimates in this release are expected to be used by customers both within and outside the government. In combination with other economic indicators, GVA estimates help build a comprehensive picture of the UK economy, and of the DCMS sectors’ importance within it. 

&nbsp;

DCMS will continue to take forward work to develop our economic estimates for DCMS sectors further. These include:


*   **Business Demographics** - In January 2019, DCMS will publish 2017 estimates of the number of businesses in DCMS sectors. 

*   **Earnings** – In 2019, DCMS will introduce new analysis on earnings data for Digital Sector employees based on the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) dataset provided by Office for National Statistics (ONS). There is a demand from digital policy colleagues to understand earnings between demographics. If there is sufficient interest in these statistics, DCMS plan to widen this analysis further in the future to include all DCMS sectors.  

&nbsp;

The next publication of DCMS Sectors Economic Estimates will be in January 2019 and will include Business Demographics in DCMS sectors. The date for this publication will be announced via the DCMS statistical release calendar nearer the time.
