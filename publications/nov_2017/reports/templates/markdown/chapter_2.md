## Chapter 2: GVA in DCMS Sectors – current prices

How accurate are these data?
<ol>
    <li>The supply and use tables are currently constructed from various data sources, some of which are not based on random samples or do not have published sampling and non-sampling errors available, making it very difficult to measure both error aspects and their impact on GVA. A measure of the sampling and non-sampling error associated with national accounts (supply and use tables) are therefore not available.</li>
    <li>As in all surveys, the estimates from the ABS are subject to various sources of error. Sampling errors are available at a 4 digit level. Further information on the quality of the ABS are published by ONS.</li>

This<sup>1</sup> chapter presents UK GVA estimates for each DCMS sector at a headline level. All estimates of GVA in this chapter are shown in current prices (i.e. not adjusted for inflation). GVA estimates are consistent with the Office for National Statistics National Accounts. Where data are not available directly from the Supply and Use tables, the Annual Business Survey (ABS) has been used to allocate GVA within the categories available in the Supply and Use tables. Further information on the methodology, including strengths and limitations of this approach, is available in Annex A of the report and the associated  [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology).

#### Summary
In 2017, the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was estimated to be at ???????, or ???????? of UK GVA. The GVA of DCMS sectors has grown at a faster rate than the economy as a whole, increasing by ?????? since 2010 (????????? in 2010). This compares to an increase of ???????????????? for the UK economy as a whole.


(hover over here to show: All estimates of GVA in this chapter are shown in current prices (i.e. not adjusted for inflation). 

Figure 2.1 shows the growth rate for DCMS sectors as a whole, whilst Table 2.1 outlines the GVA contribution in £billions for each of DCMS sectors.

**Notes**
#### 1. 2017 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2017. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2016 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2017 GVA figure will be revised next year, once the Supply Use tables have been balanced. This approach is different for Civil Society where the average proportion of the UK economy that is attributed to NPISH for 2010 to 2016 is assumed to be the same for 2017. This assumption seems reliable given the proportion does not vary much (from 1.2% to 1.4% over these years).  
#### 2. Civil Society in this table represents non-market charities sitting in the Non-profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) sector. This is an underestimate for the sector and does not include market provider charities who have passed the market test and therefore sit in the corporate sector, social enterprises and mutuals.
3. DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.
4. (p) = provisional
5. (r) = revised. Text in red show where the data have been revised due to the balancing of Supply and Use tables.
6. Data are in current prices (i.e. have not been adjusted for inflation).

Of all the DCMS sectors, the Digital Sector accounted for the largest proportion of GVA – just under half (48.7%) of all the DCMS GVA in 2017. The Creative Industries were the second largest, being responsible for 37.9% of DCMS GVA in 2017. However, it should be taken into account that there is significant overlap between DCMS sectors, as represented in Figure 1 below. For example, 26% of the Digital Sector GVA in 2017 (including things like motion picture production, or software publishing) was also within the Creative Industries GVA.


&nbsp;

With the exception of Tourism and Civil Society[^2], all these definitions are based on the Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC) codes. However, for each DCMS sector, definitions were developed individually based on internal, UK or international best practice/standards for that sector. Therefore, bringing the sectors together creates overlap between them (so, using the previous example, the definition of the Creative Industries sector, and the Digital Sector, both separately included software publishing for example). Figure 2.2 and Table 2.3 show these overlaps and how they sum to make 100% of DCMS total. Due to these overlaps, adding up the individual sector GVA proportions would give a total greater than 100%.

[^2] For Tourism, a proportion of several SIC codes are used to identify the element of the industry that is directly represented by tourism. For the GVA value for Civil Society, non-market charities in the NPISH (non-profit institutions serving households) sector are defined using SIC codes. Both of these sectors therefore enable us to identify overlap with the other DCMS sectors based on SIC codes.

Note: There is a very small (less than 0.5%) overlap between Civil Society and Tourism, and Tourism and Sport which cannot visually be identified in Figure 2.2 above.

The [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology) visually outlines the overlap between SIC codes in DCMS sectors[^3] . From this, for example, users can see that the Cultural Sector is defined using SIC codes that are all within the Creative Industries except for 4 SIC codes (manufacture of musical instruments, retail sale of music and video recording in specialised stores, reproduction of recorded media, and operation of historical sites and buildings and similar visitor attractions), whilst the Telecoms Sector is completely within the Digital Sector. Users should note that this shows the overlap of SIC codes, but not the value of GVA within these overlaps. For the overlap between sectors in terms of the value of GVA, you should use Figure 2.2 in this document.
