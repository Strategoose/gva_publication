<h3>How accurate are these data?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The supply and use tables are currently constructed from various data sources, some of which are not based on random samples or do not have published sampling and non-sampling errors available, making it difficult to measure both error aspects and their impact on GVA. A measure of the sampling and non-sampling error associated with National Accounts (supply and use tables) are therefore not available. </li>
    <li>As in all surveys, the estimates from the ABS are subject to various sources of error. Sampling errors are available at a 4 digit level. Further information on the quality of the ABS data is published by the ONS. </li>

This chapter presents UK GVA estimates for each DCMS sector at a headline level. All estimates of GVA in this chapter are shown in current prices (i.e. not adjusted for inflation). 

&nbsp;

As mentioned in Chapter 1, these estimates are based on survey data from the ONS Annual Business Survey (ABS) and National Accounts. Further information on the methodology, including strengths and limitations of this approach, is available in Annex A of the report and the associated [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology).

&nbsp;

Please note that there has been a **methodology change for the Tourism estimates in 2015 which means data prior to 2015 are not comparable**. More information is available in Table 2.1 of this report.For this reason, estimates are produced in this chapter for DCMS Sectors (excluding Tourism sector) where applicable. This does not affect data after 2015 which are comparable for all sectors.

&nbsp;
#### **Summary**
&nbsp;

In 2017, the contribution of DCMS Sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was estimated to be at **£267.7bn**, or **14.6% of UK GVA**.

&nbsp;

In 2016, DCMS Sectors accounted for 14.7% of UK GVA. These sectors saw slower growth over the past year than for the UK economy as a whole increasing by 3.4% since 2016 (£258.9bn), compared to 4.8% for the UK economy as a whole.

&nbsp;

Looking at the trend since 2010, DCMS Sectors (excluding Tourism) increased by 36.0% compared to a 28.7% growth for the UK economy as a whole in the same period. DCMS Sectors (excluding Tourism) contributed 10.9% of UK GVA, at £200.1bn in 2017. This is a 4.9% increase since 2016 (£190.7bn) compared to a 4.8% growth for the UK economy since 2016.

Figure 2.1 shows the growth rate for DCMS sectors (excluding Tourism) as a whole, whilst Table 2.1 outlines the GVA contribution in £billions for each of DCMS sectors.

**Notes**  
<font size="-4">
1.2017 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2017. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2016 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2017 GVA figure will be revised next year, once the Supply Use tables have been balanced. This approach is different for Civil Society where the average proportion of the UK economy that is attributed to NPISH for 2010 to 2016 is assumed to be the same for 2017. This assumption seems reliable given the proportion does not vary much (from 1.2% to 1.4% over these years).</font>
<font size="-4">  
2.The Civil Society figure covers non-market charities in the NPISH (non-profit institutions serving households) sector. It does not include market provider charities who have passed the market test and therefore sit in the corporate sector (these data are not currently measured by ONS on a National Accounts basis), mutuals, social enterprises or community interest companies. Therefore, this is an underestimate for the sector.</font>
<font size="-4"> 
3.DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.</font>

</font>
<font size="-4">    
7.Estimates for Tourism are based on a different methodology to all other sectors, as they are taken from the Tourism Satellite Account. Several methodology improvements were made for the 2016 Tourism data, which resulted in the 2015 data being revised. In 2016, several improvements were made to the Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS). More information on these changes can be found in Chapter 3 of the [methodology note](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology). As a result of these changes, a 15% increase was observed in the levels of visits reported by respondents. The 2015 data have been revised in line with the increased level of reporting of day visits. This change has not yet been implemented in the data prior to 2015. ONS plan to implement these changes in 2019 and therefore, caution should be taken when comparing data from 2015 onwards with previous years.

**Understanding DCMS Sector overlaps**

&nbsp;

For each DCMS Sector, definitions were developed individually based on internal, UK or international best practice/standards for that sector. With the exception of Tourism and Civil Society* , all these definitions are based on the Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC) codes. Therefore, bringing the sectors together creates overlap between them. Figure 2.2 shows these overlaps and how each sector contributes to the DCMS total

Due to these overlaps, adding up the individual sector GVA proportions would give a total greater than the actual value.

&nbsp;

 <font size="-4"> 
*For Tourism, a proportion of several SIC codes are used to identify the element of the industry that is directly represented by tourism. For the GVA value for Civil Society, non-market charities in the NPISH (non-profit institutions serving households) sector are defined using SIC codes. Both of these sectors therefore enable us to identify overlap with the other DCMS sectors based on SIC codes.</font>

</div>

&nbsp;

Table 2.2 outlines the overlaps shown in Figure 2.2 and the GVA contribution for these overlaps. As an example, 19.5% of the DCMS Sector GVA is within both the Creative Industries (as shown in the Sector 1 column) and the Digital Sector (as shown in the Sector 2 column) exclusively. Therefore, when calculating the DCMS Sector total, this is counted once. A further 6.7% of DCMS Sector GVA are accounted for by overlaps between the Creative Industries, Digital Sector and Cultural Sector (these include activities such as broadcasting and motion picture, video and TV production). These are shown in Sector 1, Sector 2 and Sector 3 columns which share this overlap, whereas only two sectors (Digital Sector and the Creative Industries) share the 19.5% overlap outlined above.

&nbsp;

There is a small overlap (0.7% of DCMS Sector GVA) between 4 of the DCMS Sectors i.e. Tourism, Cultural Sector, Creative Industries and Civil Society (shown as Sector 1, Sector 2, Sector 3 and Sector 4 in the table), contributing £1.8bn to the UK economy in 2017.

For more information, Chapter 2 of the [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology) visually outlines the overlap between SIC codes in DCMS Sectors* , but not the value of GVA within these overlaps. For the overlap between sectors in terms of the value of GVA, you should use Figure 2.2 and Table 2.2 in this document.
