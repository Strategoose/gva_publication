##Chapter 4: GVA in Chained Volume Measures
***

&nbsp;

This chapter presents UK GVA estimates for DCMS sectors shown in chained volume measures (i.e. adjusted for inflation) . These estimates of GVA are based on a similar methodology as used in the UK National Accounts, which describe volume measures derived by linking to the current monetary value in 2016. Further information on the methodology is available in the associated [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology).

**Summary**

It is estimated that in 2017, the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was **£239.8bn , or 13.4%  of UK GVA**, expressed in chained volume measures (CVM). 

The GVA of DCMS sectors  has grown at a faster rate than the UK economy as a whole, increasing by 21.4% since 2010 (£197.6bn). This compares to an increases of 15.1% for the UK economy as a whole over the same time period. There has been a steady growth in DCMS sector GVA since 2016, increasing by 1.8% (£235.6bn), although this growth has been less than for the UK economy as a whole (2.3% growth since 2016).

Figure 4.1 shows the growth rate for DCMS sectors as a whole, whilst Table 4.1 outlines the GVA contribution in £billions for each of DCMS sectors.

Notes 
1. 2017 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2017. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2016 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2017 figure therefore differs from ABMM. 2010 – 2016 GVA estimates use balanced GVA in chained volume measures (ABMM).
2. DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.
3. Data are in chained volume measures (i.e. have been adjusted for inflation).
4. (p) = provisional.
5. Data are not available for Civil Society at present.


&nbsp;


 Within each of the DCMS sectors:
 
 *	Digital Sector contributed £127.2bn to the UK economy in 2017 in terms of chained volume measures, accounting for 7.1% of UK GVA. 
 *	Cultural Sector contributed £28.9bn, 1.6% of UK economy GVA.
 *	Creative Industries contributed £99.0bn in 2017, accounting for 5.5% of UK GVA. 

These sectors have increased by 4.6%, 4.9% and 4.5% respectively since 2016, almost double the UK economy growth in the same period (at 2.3%). They have all had strong growth since 2010 too, increasing by 20.3%, 21.4% and 35.7% respectively, compared to 15.1% for the UK as a whole.

&nbsp;

There has been a steady growth in GVA in chained volume measures in the Telecoms sector since 2010, increasing by 25.9% since 2010 and contributed £32.0bn to the UK economy in 2017. The Telecoms sector increased by 1.7% since 2016, slightly less than the growth seen over this time period for the UK as a whole. The Sports sector has increased by 3.1% since 2016 from £9.3bn to £9.6bn in 2017. It has also seen similar levels of growth since 2010 as the UK as a whole (15.5% increase since 2010).

&nbsp;

The Gambling Sector decreased by 9.6% between 2016 and 2017 and 9.8% since 2010. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the Gambling Sector is a small industry and therefore can lead to some data volatility each year due to the sample size of businesses. The absolute change in GVA expressed in chained volume measures for the Gambling Sector is approximately £1 billion since 2010 and 2017. The Tourism Sector contributed £61.6bn to the UK economy in 2017, a decline of 2.7% since 2016 (£63.3bn in 2016), but an increase of 16.3% since 2010 (£53.0bn in 2010)..
