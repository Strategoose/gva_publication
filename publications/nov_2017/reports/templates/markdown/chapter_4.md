##Chapter 4: GVA in Chained Volume Measures
***

&nbsp;

This chapter presents UK GVA estimates for DCMS Sectors shown in chained volume measures (i.e. adjusted for inflation)* . These estimates of GVA are based on a similar methodology as used in the UK National Accounts, which describe volume measures derived by linking to the current monetary value in 2016. Further information on the methodology is available in the associated [methodology notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology).

*Chained Volume Measures (CVM) are different to constant prices. In CVM, the base period is updated each year, rather than the 5 year update. CVMs are created by linking together series with different base years. In this analysis we calculate Previous Year Prices and Current Year Prices (volume series in terms of last year's prices and current year prices). Constant Price is simply the current price data deflated using a price from a base period. Generally the base period is updated every 5 years (in this analysis it is 2010 as prices are based at 2010). It can be thought of as Constant Price Value. Further information on the difference in current price, constant price and chained volume measure is available [here](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107002820/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/faqs/gdp-questions/index.html).  </font> 


&nbsp;

Similar to Current Price estimates mentioned in Chapter 2, **data for the Tourism Sector in Chained Volume Measures cannot be compared to data prior to 2015 due to a change in methodology**. ONS will look to revise the previous years’ tourism data in the future. 

&nbsp;

The GVA expressed in chained volume measures does not currently include the industries covered by the Office for Civil Society. This may be developed in the future if there is sufficient user demand.

### Summary

&nbsp;

It is estimated that in 2017, the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was **£239.8bn* , or 13.4%  of UK GVA**, expressed in chained volume measures (CVM).This represented a 1.8% increase since 2016, compared to 2.3% for the UK economy as a whole. 

<font size="-4">
*All estimates of GVA are shown in chained volume measures (i.e. adjusted for inflation). The GVA expressed in Chained Volume Measures is lower than in current prices because of the effects of inflation being taken into account, but mainly due to civil society not currently being included in the Chained Volume Measures estimate.</font> 

&nbsp;

The GVA of DCMS Sectors*  (excluding Tourism) has grown at a faster rate than the UK economy as a whole, increasing by 23.2% since 2010 (£144.7bn). This compares to an increase of 15.1% for the UK economy as a whole over the same time period.

**Notes**

&nbsp;
<font size="-4">
1. 2017 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2017. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2016 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2017 figure therefore differs from ABMM. 2010 – 2016 GVA estimates use balanced GVA in chained volume measures (ABMM).

2. DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.

7. Estimates for Tourism are based on a different methodology to all other sectors, as they are taken from the Tourism Satellite Account. Several methodology improvements were made for the 2016 Tourism data, which resulted in the 2015 data being revised. In 2016, several improvements were made to the Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS). More information on these changes can be found in Chapter 3 of the [methodology note](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology). As a result of these changes, a 15% increase was observed in the levels of visits reported by respondents. The 2015 data have been revised in line with the increased level of reporting of day visits. This change has not yet been implemented in the data prior to 2015. ONS plan to implement these changes in 2019 and therefore, caution should be taken when comparing data from 2015 onwards with previous years.

&nbsp;

Of the DCMS sectors:
 
 *	Digital Sector contributed £127.2bn to the UK economy in 2017 in terms of chained volume measures, accounting for 7.1% of UK GVA. 
 *	Creative Industries contributed £99.0bn in 2017, accounting for 5.5% of UK GVA. 
 *	Cultural Sector contributed £28.9bn, 1.6% of UK economy GVA.

&nbsp;

These sectors have increased by 4.6%, 4.5% and 4.9% respectively since 2016, around double the UK economy growth in the same period (at 2.3%). They have all had strong growth since 2010 too, increasing by 20.3%, 35.7% and 21.4% respectively, compared to 15.1% for the UK as a whole.

&nbsp;

There has been a steady growth in GVA in chained volume measures in the Telecoms Sector since 2010, increasing by 25.9% since 2010 and contributing £32.0bn to the UK economy in 2017. The Telecoms Sector increased by 1.7% since 2016, slightly less than the growth seen over this time period for the UK as a whole. The Sports Sector has also increased by 3.1% since 2016 from £9.3bn to £9.6bn in 2017. It has also seen similar levels of growth since 2010 as the UK as a whole (15.5% increase since 2010). As mentioned in Chapter 3, the decline in this sector, in 2013 is likely to be caused by the effects of the UK hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.

&nbsp;

The Gambling Sector decreased by 9.6% between 2016 and 2017 and 9.8% since 2010. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the Gambling Sector is a small industry and therefore can lead to some data volatility each year due to the sample size of businesses. The absolute change in GVA expressed in chained volume measures for the Gambling Sector is approximately £1 billion between 2010 and 2017. The Tourism Sector contributed £61.6bn to the UK economy in 2017, a decline of 2.7% since 2016 (£63.3bn in 2016).
