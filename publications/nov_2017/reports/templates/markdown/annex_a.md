##Annex A: Limitations
***

&nbsp;
The estimates set out in this report are robust but there are some limitations which users should be aware of:

&nbsp;

**ABS survey design changes** – The ABS (Annual Business Survey) is used to break down the Supply and Use tables estimates to the 4 digit level. However, users should note that the ABS population was expanded in 2015 to include approximately 92,000 solely Pay As You Earn (PAYE)-based businesses. This led to an increase in the number of businesses in the overall population of approximately 4%. In 2015, these businesses increased the level of turnover by 0.4% and aGVA by 0.8%. 

Users should also note that a sample re-optimisation has been included in the ABS estimates for 2016. This is carried out every five years to improve the efficiency of the sample estimation and reduce sampling variability as part of the regular process to improve estimates. 

Both of these survey design changes can have a possible impact on the DCMS GVA estimates although the ABS is only being used to provide a proportion of the SUT so these changes should have minimal impact on the overall figures.

**Sport** - For the purposes of this publication the statistical definition of sport has been used. This incorporates only those 4 digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes which are predominately sport (see methodology note Table 2.1). DCMS also publishes estimates of sport based on the EU agreed [Vilnius definition](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/6921402/0/Vilnius+Definition+Sport+CPA2008+official+2013_09_19.pdf). The Vilnius definition is a more comprehensive measure of sport which considers the contribution of sport across a range of industries, for example sport advertising, and sport related construction. The methodology for the [DCMS Sport Satellite Account](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sport-satellite-account-for-the-uk-statistics) is currently being reviewed and therefore has not been used in these estimates.

&nbsp;

**Tourism** – Estimates for tourism used in this publication are based on a different methodology to all other sectors, as they are taken from the Tourism Satellite Account. This is an internationally recommended methodology for measurement of the contribution of tourism to the economy. The latest [Tourism Satellite Account](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/theuktourismsatelliteaccountuktsa2016) was published by ONS on 28th November 2018, and includes the latest estimates for direct tourism GVA, employment and trade.

&nbsp;

**Heritage** – The heritage sector is depicted in our estimates by one SIC code “91.03 Operation of historical sites and building and similar visitor attractions”. DCMS use standard industrial classification (SIC) codes to construct these estimates, which enables international comparability as well as comparability with national estimates. As the balance and make-up of the economy changes, the international SIC codes used here are less able to provide the detail for important elements of the UK economy related to DCMS sectors. It is therefore recognised that the published estimates are likely to be an underestimate for the Heritage sector.

&nbsp;

**Office for Civil Society** – Responsibility for the Office for Civil Society (OCS) was transferred from Cabinet Office to DCMS on 21 July 2016. OCS leads cross-government work in support of the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector (VCSE). The estimates included in this report attempt to measure the contribution of the civil society sector the UK economy. 

&nbsp;

For GVA expressed in current prices, the estimate for the Civil Society covers non-market charities sitting in the NPISH (non-profit institutions serving households) sector. It does not include market provider charities who have passed the market test and therefore sit in the corporate sector (These data are not currently measured by ONS on a National Accounts basis), mutuals, social enterprises or community interest companies. An estimate of the economic contribution of volunteering is also included, but this is not included in the “All DCMS Sectors” total due to it being part of the informal economy and therefore not part of the traditional methodology of calculating GVA.

&nbsp;

NPISH data includes non-market charities, universities, trade unions and political parties. Of these, OCS only covers charities. As balanced industry data are not available split by source (i.e. the 4 sources covering charities, universities, trade unions and political parties), we have assumed that the balancing adjustment and other inputs used during data processing, are applied in proportion to the underlying size of each source data. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the overlap between NPISH sectors and DCMS sectors due to the way the data are processed, unless there is an exact 1:1 match. For example NPISH data are processed for SIC 90, which is also within the Cultural and Tourism sector, and therefore this overlap can be removed in the ‘All DCMS Sector’ value. Conversely, NPISH data are provided for SICs 68.1 and 68.2 combined and cannot be separated. SIC 68.1 is not a DCMS industry, but SIC 68.2 is, and therefore a slight overlap will be included in the ‘All DCMS Sector’ value.  It is estimated that the overlap is a maximum of 0.2% of total UK GVA. However given that the estimates for Civil Society as a whole are an underestimate for the sector (not including market provider charities, mutuals, social enterprises and community interest companies), the ‘All DCMS Sector’ value is not an overestimate even when compensating for this small overlap.	

&nbsp;

An estimate for the Office for Civil Society **has not been included** in the GVA expressed in chained volume measures.

&nbsp;

** 2010 - 2016 GVA** – 2016 GVA has been updated from the figures published in November 2017 to take into account the latest balancing of the National Accounts and finalisation of the Annual Business Survey data. National Accounts Supply Use Tables are open to revisions back to 1997 each year resulting in some changes to the back series too. These are planned revisions and an integral part of the balancing process.

&nbsp;

**2017 GVA** - For 2017, the GVA data are taken from the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2016 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2017 figure therefore differs from National Account GVA at current basic prices (series named ABML). The only exception is for Civil Society where a different approach is used (see below for further information). Please note that the overall 2017 GVA figure is provisional and subject to change when National Accounts are published in 2019.

&nbsp;

**2017 Civil Society GVA** - The Civil Society GVA figures are based on NPISH (Non-profit institutions serving households) data. The 2016 figures cannot be identified in the output approach to GDP, which is the approach taken for other DCMS sectors. Between Blue Books the only data published on NPISH is their final consumption expenditure. It is not appropriate to use this for the 2017 estimate as it captures only one element of output with no information on intermediate consumption. The 2017 estimates published by DCMS therefore assumes the average proportion of the UK economy that is attributed to NPISH from 2010 to 2016 to be the same for 2017. The same approach is taken to identify the overlap between NPISH and other DCMS sectors (where possible).

&nbsp;

**Classifications** - Estimates have been constructed from ONS Official Statistics which use international classifications. This is an important element of the methodology due to availability of data and to enable international comparability. The ability to produce consistent figures each year also allows trends over time to be measured. However, as a result there are substantial limitations to the underlying classifications. As the balance and make-up of the economy changes the international classifications are less able to provide the detail for important elements of the UK economy related to DCMS sectors, and therefore best fit SIC codes have been used to produce these estimates.
