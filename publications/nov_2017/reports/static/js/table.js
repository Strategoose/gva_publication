This methodology varies greatly to DCMS Sector Economic Estimates. The definiton of museums is much wider than is used in DCMS' estimates which is based on one SIC code. ACE have identified the limitations with using SIC codes for museums, namely that to be included in the official statistical surveys, the museum needs to be registered for PAYE or VAT, which means some of the small museums would not be included in these official sources. The same applies to local authority delivered museum services which would be coded under the Public Administration SIC code.

The Gambling Commission derive their estimates from the operators. It is a license requirement for operators to submit returns, so essentially a census is being carried here. This has benefits over using a sample survey like DCMS use. DCMS are only using SIC 92 to define Gambling; however it is likely that there will be companies outside of SIC 92 included in the Gambling Commission statistics. For example, some working men's clubs may hold a license but would not be classified under SIC 92 by virtue of their other primary activities.

They produce a GVA and employment estimates, using a range of sources: ABS\/ASHE, 2014 Input-Output tables, Participation data and company accounts. Whilst these are not the exact same data sources as DCMS uses, or the most up to date, they do enable a comparison to DCMS statistics.
