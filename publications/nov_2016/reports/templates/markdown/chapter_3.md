##Chapter 3: GVA – chained volume measures
***

&nbsp;


This chapter presents UK GVA estimates for each DCMS sector at a headline level. All estimates of GVA are shown in chained volume measures (i.e. adjusted for inflation) . These experimental estimates meet user demand and enable DCMS to produce productivity estimates (to be published in February). These estimates of GVA are based on a similar methodology as used in the UK National Accounts, which describe volume measures derived by linking to the current monetary value in 2015. Further information on the methodology is available in the associated methodology note. These estimates are experimental, building on a methodology derived by the Office for National Statistics producing deflators for DCMS sectors. Feedback to evidence@culture.gov.uk is therefore welcome on the methodology.

Summary
It is estimated that in 2016 the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was £223bn , or 12.9   per cent of UK GVA, expressed in chained volume measures (CVM). The GVA of DCMS sectors  has grown at a faster rate than the economy as a whole, increasing by 2.4 per cent since 2015 (£217bn), and 17.2 per cent since 2010 (£190bn). This compares to increases of 2.3 per cent and 13.1 per cent respectively for the UK economy as a whole. Figure 3.1 shows the growth rate for DCMS sectors as a whole, whilst Table 3.1 outlines the GVA contribution in £billions for each of DCMS sectors.

Notes 
1. 2016 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2016. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2015 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2016 figure therefore differs from ABMM. 2010 – 2015 GVA estimates use balanced GVA in chained volume measures (ABMM).
2. DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.
3. Data are in chained volume measures (i.e. have been adjusted for inflation).
4. (p) = provisional.
5. Data are not available for Civil Society at present.
The Creative Industries had the greatest percentage increase between 2015 and 2016 (6.7%), and since 2010 (27.4%). Gambling, Telecoms and Tourism all saw decreases between 2015 and 2016 (-6.4%, -4.3% and -0.1% respectively). However all DCMS sectors showed an increase since 2010. Figure 3.2 shows the growth rate for each DCMS sector from 2010 to 2016.

The Digital Sector made up half of the DCMS sectors’ GVA in 2016 (6.7% of UK GVA), whilst Creative Industries represented nearly two fifths (5.1% of UK GVA). There is considerable overlap between the DCMS sectors for example 3.5 per cent of UK GVA is in both Creative Industries and the Digital Sector. The overlap between sectors is represented in Figure 3.3 below, and means that the individual sectors cannot be summed to get an estimate of the GVA for all DCMS sectors combined.
