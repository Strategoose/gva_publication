##Chapter 4: Next Steps

DCMS will continue to take forward work to develop our economic estimates for DCMS sectors further:

* Business Characteristics of the DCMS Sector - In December 2017, DCMS will publish 2016 estimates of the number of businesses in DCMS sectors, split by different characteristics, for example age, size and region (sample size permitting).
* Sport Satellite Account - DCMS are reviewing the methodology for the Sports Satellite Account to ensure that it is robust and replicable on an annual basis. A provisional Sport Satellite Account for 2016 will be published in January 2018, based on the same methodology as for the 2015 estimates.
* Regional GVA – DCMS are aware of the importance of the regions and variations in economic output across the UK. We have therefore worked with ONS to adopt a methodology to enable us to publish regional GVA estimates for each of our sectors. We will be publishing these in February 2018.
* Productivity - Understanding productivity is of critical importance to understanding the economic impact of DCMS sectors. We will be publishing productivity estimates for DCMS sectors in February 2018. 
* GVA, employment and trade – Updates to these publications will be available in 2018. Dates of publication will be made available on our upcoming releases web page.

The next publication of DCMS Sectors Economic Estimates will be on 20th December 2017 and will include Business Characteristics in DCMS sectors.
