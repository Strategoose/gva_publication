##Chapter 2: GVA – current prices
***

&nbsp;

This chapter presents UK GVA estimates for each DCMS sector at a headline level. All estimates of GVA are shown in current prices (i.e. not adjusted for inflation). GVA estimates are consistent with the Office for National Statistics National Accounts. Where data are not available directly from the Supply and Use tables, the Annual Business Survey (ABS) has been used to allocate GVA within the categories available in the Supply and Use tables. Further information on the methodology is available in the associated [methodology note](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcms-sectors-economic-estimates-methodology).

**Summary**
It is estimated that in 2016 the contribution of DCMS sectors to the UK economy (GVA) was {{ dcms_cont }}

(hover over here to show: All estimates of GVA in this chapter are shown in current prices (i.e. not adjusted for inflation). 

For the UK, GVA in current prices (ABML, nominal GVA, not adjusted for inflation) increased by {{ uk_change_2010 }} per cent between 2010 and 2016 and {{ uk_change_last_year }} per cent between 2015 and 2016, compared with an increase of {{ uk_change_2010_cvm }} per cent for GVA in constant prices (ABMM, real GVA, adjusted for inflation) between 2010 and 2016 and {{ uk_change_last_year_cvm }} per cent between 2015 and 2016.), or 14.2 per cent of UK GVA. The GVA of DCMS sectors has grown at a faster rate than the economy as a whole, increasing by 3.6 per cent since 2015 (£240bn in 2015), and 29.0 per cent since 2010 (£193bn in 2010). This compares to increases of 3.5 per cent and 22.7 per cent respectively for the UK economy as a whole. Figure 2.1 shows the growth rate for DCMS sectors as a whole, whilst Table 2.1 outlines the GVA contribution in £billions for each of DCMS sectors.

**Notes**
1. 2016 GVA is based on the output measure of GVA to allow consistency with the sector measures for 2016. This is aligned to average GVA up to and including 2015 (last Supply Use balanced year) but then uses growth in the output measure as a proxy for GVA beyond that. The 2016 figure therefore differs from the ONS series named ABML (GVA in current prices). 2010 – 2015 GVA estimates are balanced GVA at current prices (ABML). The 2016 GVA figure will be revised next year, once the Supply Use tables have been balanced. This approach is different for Civil Society where the average proportion of the UK economy that is attributed to NPISH for 2010 to 2015 is assumed to be the same for 2016.
2. Civil Society in this table represents non-market charities sitting in the Non-profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) sector. This is an underestimate for the sector and does not include market provider charities who have passed the market test and therefore sit in the corporate sector, social enterprises and mutuals.
3. DCMS sector total is lower than the sum of individual DCMS sectors because of overlaps between sectors.
4. (p) = provisional
5. (r) = revised. Text in red show where the data have been revised due to the balancing of Supply and Use tables.
6. Data are in current prices (i.e. have not been adjusted for inflation).

&nbsp;

**Volunteering** is a key element of the Civil Society sector. However it has not been included in the above figures due to volunteering being part of the informal economy, and therefore not captured in the ONS's methodology for calculating GVA. Any overlaps between other DCMS sectors and volunteering cannot be calculated. If we were to include volunteering in the GVA figure, then you would also need to include other unpaid home production such as child and adult care in the UK GVA total. It is estimated that in 2016, volunteering contributed £32.0bn*, 1.8 per cent to the UK economy. This includes both formal and informal volunteering activities.

&nbsp;

&ast; The total number of hours are taken from the Community Life Survey (2015/16) and multiplied by an appropriate wage rate from the ASHE survey to estimate output of frequent volunteering. Currently, we are unable to identify intermediate consumption of the voluntary activity, and have therefore assumed, the gross value added (GVA) is equal to output.

The Creative Industries had the greatest percentage increase between 2015 and 2016 (7.6%), and since 2010 (44.8%). The IT, software and computer services sub-sector drove this growth in the Creative Industries, with 11.4 per cent increase from 2015 and 2016, and a 52.8 per cent increase since 2010. This sub-sector contributed over a third (37.8%) of the Creative Industries GVA in 2016. 

&nbsp;

The Digital Sector increased by 5.8 per cent between 2015 and 2016, and by 23.3 per cent since 2010. The Computer programming, consultancy and related activities sub-sector contributed over a third (36.1%) of the Digital Sector GVA in 2016, and increased by 11.6 per cent from 2015 to 2016, and 40.6 per cent since 2010.

&nbsp;

The Cultural Sector increased by 4.4 per cent between 2015 and 2016, and by 27.1 per cent since 2010. Nearly three fifths (59.1%) of the Cultural Sector GVA was in the Film, TV and music sub-sector, where GVA increased by 5.5 per cent between 2015 and 2016, and 23.9 per cent since 2010.

&nbsp;

Civil Society, Gambling and Telecoms all saw decreases between 2015 and 2016. Figure 2.2 shows the growth rate for each DCMS sector.

&nbsp;

The Digital Sector alone made up nearly half of the DCMS sectors’ GVA in 2016 (6.7% of UK GVA), whilst Creative Industries represented over a third (5.3% of UK GVA). There is considerable overlap between the DCMS sectors, for example 3.6 per cent of UK GVA is in both the Creative Industries and the Digital Sector. The overlap between sectors is represented in Figure 1 on the first page of this report, and means that the individual sectors cannot be summed to get an estimate of the GVA for all DCMS sectors combined.
